What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This course focused on understanding and applying various data models—such as binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists—within software applications. The goal was to determine which structures were most appropriate for solving specific problems efficiently.

How did you approach the problem? Why is understanding data structures important?
I approached the problem by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and choosing the one best suited for the task at hand. Understanding data structures is crucial because they directly impact the performance, scalability, and maintainability of an application.

How did you overcome any roadblocks during the activities or project?
When I encountered challenges, I referred to official documentation, searched for example implementations, or built small prototype programs to test and refine my understanding. This hands-on experimentation helped me gradually build more complex solutions.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to software design and development?
Big-O analysis had a major impact on how I think about performance and algorithm design. It also highlighted that I tend to avoid recursive thinking, which is something I now recognize as a limitation and an area for growth.

How has your work on this project improved your ability to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code?
Through repeated practice, I’ve developed patterns and reusable code elements, such as file stream handling functions. I’m now considering packaging frequently used logic into personal libraries, which would improve code reuse and consistency across future projects.
